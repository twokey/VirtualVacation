# VirtualTourist

Explore the world from your couch. Select any location on a map and the app creates an album of pictures for that location. Pictures are stored on the device so that you can review them later even you don't have a reliable connection.

## Motivation for the project

Core Data is a nightmare in the beginning I though. But wait there is more to it. Core Data and concurrency! This application with simple user interface, but comprehensive architecture allows you to explore pictures around the world. You can choose any location with a tap and the app creates an album of the pictures from that location. It downloads pictures using Flickr API and stores them in Core Data.
By the end of this project I become a Jedi master of of Core Data. Virtual Tourist utilize GCD framework and do all the work (networking with Flickr API and saving albums to CoreData) while keeping UI responsive. After I complete this project I was ready to build my own app. Don’t hesitate a second and check out Nanook – travel application. You will be wondering how you could travel without it.
